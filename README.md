A spec-compliant fork of https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer

Specifically, it has patches for https://github.com/solid-contrib/test-suite/issues/145 and https://github.com/solid-contrib/test-suite/issues/146.

The patches are not very well written but the main intend is to show how to make CSS pass the [web-access-control-tests](https://github.com/solid-contrib/web-access-control-tests).

See [SolidServers.org](https://solidservers.org/#table) for more info on various Solid server implementations.
